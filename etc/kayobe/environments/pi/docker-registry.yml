# Dict of environment variables to provide to the docker registry container.
# This allows to configure the registry by overriding specific configuration
# options, as described at https://docs.docker.com/registry/configuration/
# For example, the registry can be configured as a pull through cache to Docker
# Hub by setting REGISTRY_PROXY_REMOTEURL to "https://registry-1.docker.io".
# Note that it is not possible to push to a registry configured as a
# pull through cache. Default is an empty dict.
